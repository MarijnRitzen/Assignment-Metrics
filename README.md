# Introduction

This repository contains the files needed to start on the metrics assignment for 2IMP25.
Contained within this repository are a 6 versions of the itextpdf library, downloaded from Maven.
Additionally, two compiled .jars are included, `ckjm` which computes metrics and `layer_extractor` which analyzes the architecture of a jar to determine to which layer each class belongs.

## `CKJM`

To run ckjm two arguments are expected:
1.	The relative part to the jar file that needs to be analyzed
2.	The relative part to the libriariesâ€™ folder of the jar
Both types of information are included in the versions.csv file

Example usage:

`java -jar ckjm_adapted.jar versions/5.0.6/itextpdf-5.0.6.jar versions/5.0.6/lib`

Note: Given some issues when analyzing the 5.5.13.3 version of itextpdf, you can find the output in csv format in the root directory (ck-metrics-5.5.13.3.csv)

## `layer_extractor`

To run layer extractor one argument is needed, that is  the relative path to the jar file that needs to be analyzed

Example usage:

`java -jar layer_extractor.jar versions/5.0.6/itextpdf-5.0.6.jar`
